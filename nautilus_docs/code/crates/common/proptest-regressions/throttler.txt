TITLE: Proptest Seed for Repeated SendMessage Failure
DESCRIPTION: This seed represents a specific input sequence that caused a failure in a proptest run. The 'cc' prefix indicates a comment or a specific seed format. The input consists of ten repetitions of 'SendMessage(42)', which was identified as a shrinking target for a past failure.
