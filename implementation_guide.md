Here is a detailed implementation guide explaining exactly what you need to build to make your ZerodhaInstrumentProvider functional. This guide assumes you will follow the file structure we discussed and focuses on the "how-to" without writing the code itself.

To make the ZerodhaInstrumentProvider work, you need to implement three key components within your nautilus_zerodha package. Think of them as layers, with each layer depending on the one below it.

Implementation Guide: Building the ZerodhaInstrumentProvider
Layer 1: The Configuration (config.py)

This is the foundation. It's how traderunner passes credentials securely and cleanly to your adapter.

Objective: Create a configuration class to hold API credentials.

File to Edit: nautilus_zerodha/config.py

Steps:

Define the Class: Create a new Python class named ZerodhaAdapterConfig. For consistency with the Nautilus ecosystem, it's good practice to have it inherit from a base config class, like nautilus_trader.live.config.LiveDataClientConfig.

Add Fields for Credentials: Inside this class, define the fields that are necessary for authentication with the Zerodha API. Based on your description, these will be:

api_key: A string field.

access_token: A string field.

Add Optional Fields: It's also wise to add a field for the API's base_url. This makes your adapter more flexible for testing against a mock server or if Zerodha ever changes its endpoints. Make this optional with a default value.

Layer 2: The API Client (api.py)

This component is the specialist that handles all direct communication with the Zerodha API. It uses the configuration from Layer 1.

Objective: Create an asynchronous client that fetches raw instrument data from Zerodha.

File to Edit: nautilus_zerodha/api.py

Steps:

Define the Class: Create a class named ZerodhaApiClient. It should not inherit from any Nautilus class; it's a pure helper.

Implement the Constructor (__init__): The constructor must accept one argument: an instance of your ZerodhaAdapterConfig from Layer 1. Store this config object internally (e.g., as self.config).

Implement the Core Method: Create an async method to fetch the instrument data. Let's call it get_all_instruments_async.

Inside this method:

Construct the URL: Form the full URL for Zerodha's instrument download endpoint (e.g., https://api.kite.trade/instruments).

Construct the Headers: Create the required HTTP headers for authentication. This is where you use the stored config: create an Authorization header using the api_key and access_token from self.config.

Make the API Call: Use an asynchronous HTTP library like aiohttp or httpx to make a GET request to the URL with the headers you just created. Remember to await this call.

Handle the Response: Check the HTTP status code of the response. If it's not successful (e.g., 401 Unauthorized), you should raise an exception to signal that something went wrong.

Return the Data: If the call is successful, parse the response body. Zerodha's instrument API likely returns a CSV. You'll need to parse this CSV data into a list of dictionaries or a similar structure that's easy to work with in Python. Return this list of raw instrument data.

Layer 3: The Instrument Provider (providers.py)

This is the final layer and your primary goal. It uses the ZerodhaApiClient from Layer 2 to get raw data and translates it into the language of Nautilus.

Objective: Implement the ZerodhaInstrumentProvider to load and translate instrument data.

File to Edit: nautilus_zerodha/providers.py

Steps:

Define the Class: Create the class ZerodhaInstrumentProvider. It must inherit from nautilus_trader.common.providers.InstrumentProvider. This is a strict requirement of the framework.

Implement the Constructor (__init__): The constructor needs the API client to do its work. It should accept one argument: an instance of your ZerodhaApiClient from Layer 2. Inside the constructor, also create an empty dictionary to act as an internal cache for the translated instruments (e.g., self._instruments = {}).

Implement the Required Methods:

load_all_async:

Call the get_all_instruments_async method on your ZerodhaApiClient instance and await the result. This will give you the raw list of instrument data.

Loop through each raw instrument in the list.

Perform the Translation: This is the most important step. For each raw instrument, you will:

Read its properties (like tradingsymbol, tick_size, lot_size, exchange, etc.).

Create an instance of the appropriate Nautilus Instrument subclass (e.g., Equity, FuturesContract).

Map the Zerodha fields to the Nautilus Instrument constructor arguments. For example, raw['tick_size'] maps to the tick_size parameter.

Construct the unique Nautilus InstrumentId by combining the symbol and venue (e.g., "INFY.NSE").

Store the newly created, fully-formed Nautilus Instrument object in your internal cache dictionary, using its InstrumentId as the key.

find(instrument_id): This method is simple. It should just look up the given instrument_id in your internal cache (self._instruments) and return the corresponding Nautilus Instrument object if it exists.

list_all(): This method should simply return a list of all the values from your internal cache dictionary.

How traderunner Will Use These Components

Your traderunner application gets the api_key and access_token.

It creates an instance of ZerodhaAdapterConfig with these credentials.

It creates an instance of ZerodhaApiClient, passing the config object to it.

It creates an instance of ZerodhaInstrumentProvider, passing the API client object to it.

It calls await provider.load_all_async().

After these steps, your traderunner can use provider.find("INFY.NSE") and will receive a perfectly formed Nautilus Equity object, ready to be used in backtesting or live trading. You have successfully bridged the two systems.
